Alternative methods such as surveys, censuses, or surveillance are not adequate substitutes from a statistical perspective, and do not provide individuals with the legal documentation they need to benefit from services and participate fully in a modern society. Research is needed to generate and disseminate evidence about which CRVS strategies work best in which contexts and to ensure that the potential benefits of innovation are successfully scaled up, and that possible pitfalls are avoided. Research findings need to be compiled and made readily accessible to users for policy making, programming, and practice. Modernisation of CRVS systems necessitates new, broad-based national and international coalitions. The global architecture for CRVS, so far dominated by UN agencies, should extend to include bilateral donors, funds, foundations, non-governmental organisations, the private sector, academic institutions, and civil society. This change is essential to ensure that further development of CRVS systems is inclusive, participatory, multisectoral, and has a strong evidence base.},

The key to success has been to build collaborative partnerships involving local ownership by several sectors that span registration, justice, health, statistics, and civil society. Regional partners can be important to raise awareness, set regional goals and targets, foster country-to-country exchange and mutual learning, and build high-level political commitment. These regional partners continue to provide a platform through which country stakeholders, development partners, and technical experts can share experiences, develop and document good practices, and propose innovative approaches to tackle CRVS challenges.

	title = {When civil registration is inadequate: interim methods for generating vital statistics.},
	volume = {18},
	abstract = {Comprehensive guidelines and tools to help countries rapidly improve their vital statistics systems, based on international best practice are now available. For many countries, however, attainment of timely, accurate statistics on births and deaths and causes of death will require years of strategic and prioritized investment, with technical assistance from WHO, the United Nations, and academia. In the meantime, however, countries will need accurate and unbiased data in order to measure progress with their health programs and broader development goals, such as the MDGs and the growing crisis of non-communicable diseases. This article has introduced some interim strategies that can yield adequate vital statistics and cause of death data as countries work to strengthen their civil registration systems. These methods mirror the skills, practices and advantages of complete and functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems, but for a sample of the population. They are based on the principle of rigorous and continuous data collection for a defined and manageable part of the population. Doing "smaller, representative" populations well rather than "larger populations poorly" will reduce the biases that would otherwise occur from missing data, incorrect application of data management procedures, poor data quality checking and lack of medical certification of causes of death. A critical component of this strategy is to routinely apply verbal autopsy methods to collect essential cause of death data. When properly applied, VA can yield population-based cause of death data of comparable quality to what is typically collected in hospitals in developing countries. Moreover, with the availability of automated methods to diagnose causes of death, it is now possible to obtain accurate cause of death data routinely, cheaply and quickly in resource-poor settings. The long-term goal of strengthening civil registration and vital statistics systems is to ensure that every birth and death is properly registered, and that causes of death are accurately certified. Stakeholders wishing to establish sentinel surveillance or sample registration should work in collaboration with national and local authorities responsible for civil registration and should support and promote the formal registration of births and deaths whenever possible. In addition, sentinel or sample registration systems should help strengthen the capacity of the health system to correctly certify the causes of death for each decedent.},

Due to the inadequate capacity of Routine Health Information Systems (RHIS), many developing countries face a lack of quality pre-disaster health-related data and efficient post-disaster data processes in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Considering the significance of local capacity during the early stages of disaster response, RHIS at local, provincial/state and national levels need to be strengthened so that they provide relief personnel up-to-date information to plan, organize and monitor immediate relief activities. RHIS professionals should be aware of specific information needs in disaster response (according to the Sphere Project's Humanitarian Minimum Standards) and requirements in data processes to fulfil those information needs. Preparing RHIS for disasters can be guided by key RHIS-strengthening frameworks; and disaster preparedness must be incorporated into countries' RHIS. Mechanisms must be established in non-disaster times and maintained between RHIS and information systems of non-health sectors for exchanging disaster-related information and sharing technologies and cost.},

This paper examines the practical difficulties of health care provision amidst inadequate statistics to inform decisions. Major obstacles to the introduction of effective health information systems in developing countries are examined, and practical suggestions on measures to overcome them discussed. It is concluded that the establishment of well co-ordinated information collection systems at the various levels of the health care system in developing countries, using appropriate staff, could contribute greatly to improvements in health care delivery.},

	abstract = {Today e-health data and its usage in various dimensions is one of the most discussed issues. The nature of health data is heterogeneous and distributed, accessed through varied formats and architectures supporting different vocabularies. Interoperable electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are the most important enabling tools on the road to patient-centric care, a lifeline for continuity of care and support to mobility of patients. Also, hospitals refer cases to other hospitals located in same or different cities or countries altogether leading to sharing of information. This generates the reason to study the suitability of available models and protocols enabling exchange of sensitive and time critical health information during open-ended transmission. The issue of sharing data in integrated applications is highly significant and affected by various implicit and explicit factors in terms of technologies and adoption by health providers. Varied architectural approaches are implemented by vendors for designing a HIS (Hospital Information System) without giving any consideration to integrated and interoperable sharing of data. Such disparate systems are best when used in isolation but very weak when try to talk with each other. This paper aims to review issues related creation of architectures in the perspective of sharing of electronic health records and the challenges faced by them in an interoperable environment.},

The underlying premise was that encouraging use in small incremental steps could help to break the vicious cycle and improve the HMIS.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nLOCAL SETTING: To test the hypothesis at the national and district levels a project to strengthen the HMIS was established in Zanzibar. The project included quarterly data-use workshops during which district staff assessed their own routine data and critiqued their colleagues' data.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRELEVANT CHANGES: The data-use workshops generated inputs that were used by District Health Information Software developers to improve the tool. The HMIS, which initially covered only primary care outpatients and antenatal care, eventually grew to encompass all major health programmes and district and referral hospitals. The workshops directly contributed to improvements in data coverage, data set quality and rationalization, and local use of target indicators.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nLESSONS LEARNT: Data-use workshops with active engagement of data users themselves can improve health information systems overall and enhance staff capacity for information use, presentation and analysis for decision-making.},

	abstract = {Health Information Systems (HIS) in Uganda always fail to achieve the organizational objectives and yet little research has been conducted to study the strategic alignment of HIS in the country. This study therefore set out to examine the antecedents and dynamics that influence strategic alignment of HIS in Uganda with the aim of adequately addressing the complex IS design issues. A total of 296 respondents were purposively selected from 39 health facilities across the country to participate in the survey. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings from the study revealed that HIS are used to locate substitute sources for medical commodities, reduce costs of handling orders as well as minimize uncertainty in ordering lead time. In addition, HIS provide information to clients, add value to existing health services and are used to target health service needs with accuracy as well as identify groups of clients whose needs are not being met. HIS are used to minimize the cost of designing services, adding features to existing services and population grouping services at the health unit level. In the area of internal health facility efficiency, HIS help in ensuring efficiency and enable informed decision making, provide efficiency in internal meetings and discussions, co-ordination among facility departments, and provide good evaluation on annual budget. Further, HIS are used by health workers to provide evaluation on capital, maximize organizational performance, population coverage and strategic planning efficiency. Despite the above, the study revealed that health units do not have standards, frameworks and policies for the strategic alignment of HIS and the funding to support them. For better alignment of HIS, there should be proper planning and training of health workers on the importance of strategic alignment of HIS. Further, health facilities should be encouraged to adopt electronic information systems to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. There should also be policies, frameworks and or standards for guiding strategic alignment of Health Information Systems in health facilities.},

The relevant study was identified in major databases and well-known institutional websites. We found the dimension of data was most frequently assessed. Completeness, accuracy, and timeliness were the three most-used attributes among a total of 49 attributes of data quality. The major quantitative assessment methods were descriptive surveys and data audits, whereas the common qualitative assessment methods were interview and documentation review. The limitations of the reviewed studies included inattentiveness to data use and data collection process, inconsistency in the definition of attributes of data quality, failure to address data users' concerns and a lack of systematic procedures in data quality assessment. This review study is limited by the coverage of the databases and the breadth of public health information systems. Further research could develop consistent data quality definitions and attributes. More research efforts should be given to assess the quality of data use and the quality of data collection process.},

	volume = {29},
	abstract = {There is a growing awareness of the need to approach health problems intersectorally. This has important implications for health policy management, centrally so for the informations systems which should enable 'managers' to monitor performance and also provide feedback to those with broader policy responsibilities. Yet relatively little is being done to adjust the information systems to this new intersectoral awareness: the focus of health information systems remains the collection of health service data. Much of the information collected is not used to provide adequate feedback to planners and managers, and to influence programme implementation. The paper--which focuses on the problems in less developed countries--argues that more attention needs to be paid to analysing the expected links between interventions and outcomes, as well as to cost considerations. Flexible procedures are required to address locally or regionally relevant problems. Thought must be given to making information of interest to health workers by linking it to the outcomes of activities, and by enabling them to discuss the implications of findings. Community members may also be thus involved. Often such processes are wholly neglected. The paper examines institutional and political arrangements that influence the capacity to use information for management and policy making, and which need to be understood if information systems are to be broadened beyond the health sector. The paper ends by discussing the main indicators which have been proposed, and occasionally used, to broaden health monitoring in an intersectoral direction. It argues that much relevant information is being routinely produced by the various departments and discusses briefly how such information can be used to build up gradually an intersectoral information system for health.},

One fairly narrow but widespread interpretation of this revolution is for international aid donors to fund a coordinated wave of household surveys across the developing world, tracking progress on a new round of post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. We use data from the International Household Survey Network (IHSN) to show (i) the supply of household surveys has accelerated dramatically over the past 30 years and that (ii) demand for survey data appears to be higher in democracies and more aid-dependent countries. We also show that given existing international survey programs, the cost to international aid donors of filling remaining survey gaps is manageable--on the order of \$300 million per year. We argue that any aid-financed expansion of household surveys should be complemented with (a) increased access to data through open data protocols, and (b) simultaneous support for the broader statistical system, including routine administrative data systems.},

Health management information systems (HMIS) exist to address this need at national scales across Africa but are failing to deliver adequate data because of widespread underreporting by health facilities. Faced with this inadequacy, vital public health decisions often rely on crudely adjusted regional and national estimates of treatment burdens. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study has taken the example of presumed malaria in outpatients within the largely incomplete Kenyan HMIS database and has defined a geostatistical modelling framework that can predict values for all data that are missing through space and time. The resulting complete set can then be used to define treatment burdens for presumed malaria at any level of spatial and temporal aggregation. Validation of the model has shown that these burdens are quantified to an acceptable level of accuracy at the district, provincial, and national scale. CONCLUSIONS: The modelling framework presented here provides, to our knowledge for the first time, reliable information from imperfect HMIS data to support evidence-based decision-making at national and sub-national levels.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Well-working health information systems are considered vital with the quality of health data ranked of highest importance for decision making at patient care and policy levels. In particular, health facilities play an important role, since they are not only the entry point for the national health information system but also use health data (and primarily) for patient care. DESIGN: A multiple case study was carried out between March and August 2012 at the antenatal care (ANC) clinics of two private and one public Kenyan hospital to describe clinical information systems and assess the quality of information. The following methods were developed and employed in an iterative process: workplace walkthroughs, structured and in-depth interviews with staff members, and a quantitative assessment of data quality (completeness and accurate transmission of clinical information and reports in ANC). Views of staff and management on the quality of employed information systems, data quality, and influencing factors were captured qualitatively. RESULTS: Staff rated the quality of information higher in the private hospitals employing computers than in the public hospital which relies on paper forms. Several potential threats to data quality were reported. Limitations in data quality were common at all study sites including wrong test results, missing registers, and inconsistencies in reports. Feedback was seldom on content or quality of reports and usage of data beyond individual patient care was low. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that the limited data quality has to be seen in the broader perspective of the information systems in which it is produced and used. The combination of different methods has proven to be useful for this. To improve the effectiveness and capabilities of these systems, combined measures are needed which include technical and organizational aspects (e.g. regular feedback to health workers) and individual skills and motivation.},

	abstract = {Applications of modern methods for analyzing data with missing values, based primarily on multiple imputation, have in the last half-decade become common in American politics and political behavior. Scholars in these fields have thus increasingly avoided the biases and inefficiencies caused by ad hoc methods like listwise deletion and best guess imputation. However, researchers in much of comparative politics and international relations, and others with similar data, have been unable to do the same because the best available imputation methods work poorly with the time-series cross-section data structures common in these fields. We attempt to rectify this situation. First, we build a multiple imputation model that allows smooth time trends, shifts across cross-sectional units, and correlations over time and space, resulting in far more accurate imputations. Second, we build nonignorable missingness models by enabling analysts to incorporate knowledge from area studies experts via priors on individual missing cell values, rather than on difficult-to-interpret model parameters. Third, since these tasks could not be accomplished within existing imputation algorithms, in that they cannot handle as many variables as needed even in the simpler cross-sectional data for which they were designed, we also develop a new algorithm that substantially expands the range of computationally feasible data types and sizes for which multiple imputation can be used. These developments also made it possible to implement the methods introduced here in freely available open source software that is considerably more reliable than existing strategies.},

Routine health information systems (RHIS) are defined as systems that provide information at regular intervals of a year or less to meet predictable information needs. These include paper-based or electronic health records and facility- and district-level management information systems. RHIS are receiving increasing attention as an essential component of efficient, country-owned, integrated national systems. To guide investment decisions on RHIS, evidence is needed on which types of RHIS interventions work and which do not. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This chapter is a systematic review of the literature on the evaluation of RHIS interventions in low- and middle-income countries, starting from the premise that investments in RHIS could be better understood and so produce greater benefits than they currently do. FINDINGS: We describe the conceptual literature on the determinants of RHIS performance and its role in improving health systems functioning, discuss the evidence base on the effectiveness of strategies to improve RHIS performance, provide an overview of RHIS evaluation challenges, and make suggestions to improve the evidence base. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The goal is to help ensure that (a) RHIS interventions are appropriately designed and implemented to improve health systems functioning and (b) resulting RHIS information is used more effectively.},

	abstract = {Information garnered from health information systems (HIS) is essential for monitoring health, and for evaluating and improving the delivery of health-care services and programs. Yet the collection, collation, compilation, analysis and reporting of health data in most developing countries is faced with major problems resulting in incomplete, inaccurate and untimely data which is not useful for health decision-making. Increasingly there is growing demand for good quality health information from developing countries as a result of performance based resource allocation by donors. This has led to some initiatives in these countries to reform the existing paper-based systems through computerization. Kenya’s development blueprint titled ‘Vision 2030: First Medium Term Plan (2008-2012)’ identified the need to strengthen the national HIS to enable it provide timely and understandable information on health. But assessments conducted in the country in the past revealed that despite rising demand for health information, the Kenya HIS was weak and poorly integrated. Recognizing the critical role played by a functional HIS, the country initiated an overhaul of the existing system to replace it with the free and open-source web-based District Health Information Software (DHIS2).{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}nThis review study looks at the challenges of implementing HIS in developing countries, and how various countries are attempting to overcome these challenges through computerization. In particular we examine the increasing use of the free and open source DHIS2 as the HIS solution for various developing countries and review the outcome of several cases where DHIS2 has been implemented in Africa. Against this backdrop we address the potential of DHIS2 as a motivator for health data availability and use in Kenya. {\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}nIt is evident that the DHIS2 system has presented unprecedented potential for Kenya to move from the era of unreliable and fragmented HIS system to the more ideal situation of availability and use of quality health information for rational decision making. However it is also apparent that implementation of a technically sound system like DHIS2 is not an end in itself in ensuring improved reporting and use of HIS data. The need for acceptance and adequate support from the national and local authorities, and by all targeted users of this system cannot be overemphasized},

We document Uganda's experience in strengthening routine health data reporting through the roll-out of the District Health Management Information Software System version 2 (DHIS2).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: DHIS2 was adopted at the national level in January 2011. The system was initially piloted in 4 districts, before it was rolled out to all the 112 districts by July 2012. As part of the roll-out process, 35 training workshops targeting 972 users were conducted throughout the country. Those trained included Records Assistants (168, 17.3\%), District Health Officers (112, 11.5\%), Health Management Information System Focal Persons (HMIS-FPs) (112, 11.5\%), District Biostatisticians (107, 11\%) and other health workers (473, 48.7\%). To assess improvements in health reporting, we compared data on completeness and timeliness of outpatient and inpatient reporting for the period before (2011/12) and after (2012/13) the introduction of DHIS2. We reviewed data on the reporting of selected health service coverage indicators as a proxy for improved health reporting, and documented implementation challenges and lessons learned during the DHIS2 roll-out process.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Completeness of outpatient reporting increased from 36.3\% in 2011/12 to 85.3\% in 2012/13 while timeliness of outpatient reporting increased from 22.4\% to 77.6\%. Similarly, completeness of inpatient reporting increased from 20.6\% to 57.9\% while timeliness of inpatient reporting increased from 22.5\% to 75.6\%. There was increased reporting on selected health coverage indicators (e.g. the reporting of one-year old children who were immunized with three doses of pentavelent vaccine increased from 57\% in 2011/12 to 87\% in 2012/13). Implementation challenges included limited access to computers and internet (34\%), inadequate technical support (23\%) and limited worker force (18\%).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: Implementation of DHIS2 resulted in improved timeliness and completeness in reporting of routine outpatient, inpatient and health service usage data from the district to the national level. Continued onsite support supervision and mentorship and additional system/infrastructure enhancements, including internet connectivity, are needed to further enhance the performance of DHIS2.},

The statistical analysis was descriptive with adjustment for clustering.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Most of the HMIS departments complied with formal guidance to develop departmental plans. However, only a few (3/22) had carried out a data quality audit in the 12 months prior to the survey. On average 3\% (range 1-8\%) of the total hospital income was allocated to the HMIS departments. About half of the records officer positions were filled and about half (13/22) of hospitals had implemented some form of electronic health record largely focused on improving patient billing and not linked to the district HIS. Completeness of manual patient registers varied, being 90\% (95\% CI 80.1-99.3\%), 75.8\% (95\% CI 68.7-82.8\%), and 58\% (95\% CI 50.4-65.1\%) in maternal child health clinic, maternity, and pediatric wards, respectively. Vital events notification rates were low with 25.7, 42.6, and 71.3\% of neonatal deaths, infant deaths, and live births recorded, respectively. Routine hospital reports suggested slight over-reporting of live births and under-reporting of fresh stillbirths and neonatal deaths.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Study findings indicate that the HMIS does not deliver quality data. Significant constraints exist in data quality assurance, supervisory support, data infrastructure in respect to information and communications technology application, human resources, financial resources, and integration.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread aims to strengthen the Health Information System (HIS) as a tool for decentralised health care, there is a strong tendency in most developing countries that the HIS continues to reflect the central level's needs and requirements. The traditional design approach with little or no end user involvement results in a centralised HIS with an extensive, somewhat inappropriate, but also inflexible set of standards. Consequently, the HIS is not very useful for the wished-for decentralisation of health services, and there is an urgent need to redesign the existing HIS in order to make it locally relevant and appropriately decentralised. Based on a comparative case analysis of the HIS in Tanzania and Ethiopia, we offer practical recommendations on the way to achieve this redesign. A central design goal should be to achieve a balance between centralised control and local autonomy. Some degree of control over a decentralised HIS, including budgets and the use of resources, should be delegated to the district administration. In order to achieve the aim of a locally relevant, well-working HIS, it is necessary that appropriate authority, capacity and decentralised allocation of resources for HIS will be developed at the district and sub-district levels.

It was inspired by work in Vietnam and other places. The article discusses the basic principles on which a well-functioning HIS needs to rest regardless of the technical means employed (paper, electronic devices). Eleven principles for designing or reforming a HIS are identified, including: explicit description of the underlying units (target population) and variables; no list of indicators to be fixed in advance; only one register per target population; technical coordination between registers and reports; correction algorithms; local use of data and indicators; autonomy of health institutions regarding the information that concerns them; and novel use of registers for various studies. Apart from their technical role, these principles give shape to the philosophy that underlies this article, and make clear that a HIS is not only a tool for collecting indicators; it is intimately tied to clinical and preventive practice, as well as to health management and health economy. In fact, it permeates the entire health system. It can potentially play a much more extended, varied, and useful role than simply that of providing health services to a community.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ensuring that data collected through national health information systems are of sufficient quality for meaningful interpretation is a challenge in many resource-limited countries. An assessment was conducted to identify strengths and weaknesses of the health data management and reporting systems that capture and transfer routine monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) data in Botswana. METHODS: This was a descriptive, qualitative assessment. In-depth interviews were conducted at the national (n = 27), district (n = 31), and facility/community (n = 71) levels to assess i) M\&E structures, functions, and capabilities; ii) indicator definitions and reporting guidelines; iii) data collection forms and tools; iv) data management processes; and v) links with the national reporting system. A framework analysis was conducted using ATLAS.ti v6.1. RESULTS: Health programs generally had standardized data collection and reporting tools and defined personnel for M\&E responsibilities at the national and district levels. Best practices unique to individual health programs were identified and included a variety of relatively low-resource initiatives such as attention to staffing patterns, making health data more accessible for evidence-based decision-making, developing a single source of information related to indicator definitions, data collection tools, and management processes, and utilization of supportive supervision visits to districts and facilities. Weakness included limited ownership of M\&E-related duties within facilities, a lack of tertiary training programs to build M\&E skills, few standard practices related to confidentiality and document storage, limited dissemination of indicator definitions, and limited functionality of electronic data management systems. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing fundamental M\&E system issues, further standardization of M\&E practices, and increasing health services management responsiveness to time-sensitive information are critical to sustain progress related to health service delivery in Botswana. In addition to high-resource initiatives, such as investments in electronic medical record systems and tertiary training programs, there are a variety of low-resource initiatives, such as regular data quality checks, that can strengthen national health information systems. Applying best practices that are effective within one health program to data management and reporting systems of other programs is a practical approach for strengthening health informatics and improving data quality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To address the shortage of health information personnel within Botswana, an innovative human resources approach was taken. University graduates without training or experience in health information or health sciences were hired and provided with on-the-job training and mentoring to create a new cadre of health worker: the district Monitoring and Evaluation (M\&E) Officer. This article describes the early outcomes, achievements, and challenges from this initiative. METHODS: Data were collected from the district M\&E Officers over a 2-year period and included a skills assessment at baseline and 12 months, pre- and post-training tests, interviews during stakeholder site visits, a survey of achievements, focus group discussions, and an attrition assessment. RESULTS: An average of 2.7 mentoring visits were conducted for M\&E Officers in each district. There were five training sessions over 18 months. Knowledge scores significantly increased (p {\textless} 0.05) during the three trainings in which pre/post tests were administered. Over 1 year, there were significant improvements (p {\textless} 0.05) in self-rated skills related to computer literacy, checking data validity, implementing data quality procedures, using data to support program planning, proposing indicators, and writing M\&E reports. Out of the 34 district M\&E Officers interviewed during site visits, most were conducting facility visits to review data (27/34; 79\%), comparing data sets over time (31/34; 91\%), backing up data (32/34; 94\%), and analyzing data (32/34; 94\%). Common challenges included late facility reports (28/34; 82\%), lack of transportation (22/34; 65\%), inaccurate facility reports (10/34; 29\%), and colleagues' misunderstanding of M\&E (10/34; 29\%). Six posts were vacated in the first year (6/51; 12\%). A total of 49 Officers completed the achievements survey; of these, common accomplishments related to improvements in data management (35/49; 71\%), data quality (31/49; 63\%), data use (29/49; 59\%), and capacity development (26/49; 53\%). CONCLUSIONS: The development of a cadre of district M\&E Officers has contributed positively to the health information system in Botswana. In the absence of tertiary training related to health information, on-the-job training and mentoring of university graduates can be an effective approach for developing a new professional cadre of M\&E expertise and for strengthening capacity within a national health system.},

We apply a composite index (the vital statistics performance index [VSPI]) to assess the performance of CRVS systems in 148 countries or territories during 1980-2012 and classify them into five distinct performance categories, ranging from rudimentary (with scores close to zero) to satisfactory (with scores close to one), with a mean VSPI score since 2005 of 0·61 (SD 0·31). As expected, the best performing systems were mostly in the European region, the Americas, and Australasia, with only two countries from east Asia and Latin America. Most low-scoring countries were in the African or Asian regions. Globally, only modest progress has been made since 2000, with the percentage of deaths registered increasing from 36\% to 38\%, and the percentage of children aged under 5 years whose birth has been registered increasing from 58\% to 65\%. However, several individual countries have made substantial improvements to their CRVS systems in the past 30 years by capturing more deaths and improving accuracy of cause-of-death information. Future monitoring of the effects of CRVS strengthening will greatly benefit from application of a metric like the VSPI, which is objective, costless to compute, and able to identify components of the system that make the largest contributions to good or poor performance.},

The data improvement intervention, which was implemented between May 2008 and March 2009, involved training on data collection and feedback for health information personnel and programme managers, monthly data reviews and data audits at health-care facilities. Data on six data elements used to monitor PMTCT services and recorded in the information system were compared with source data from health facility registers before, during and after the intervention. Data completeness (i.e. their presence in the system) and accuracy (i.e. being within 10\% of their true value) were evaluated.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nFINDINGS: The level of data completeness increased from 26\% before to 64\% after the intervention. Similarly, the proportion of data in the information system considered accurate increased from 37\% to 65\% (P {\textless} 0.0001). Moreover, the correlation between data in the information system and those from facility registers rose from 0.54 to 0.92.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: A simple, practical data improvement intervention significantly increased the completeness and accuracy of the data used to monitor PMTCT services in South Africa.},

Mozambique, Ghana, and Tanzania all focus on improving the quality and use of the existing Ministry of Health HIS, while the Zambia and Rwanda partnerships have introduced new information and communication technology systems or tools. All partnerships have adopted a flexible, iterative approach in designing and refining the development of new tools and approaches for HIS enhancement (such as routine data quality audits and automated troubleshooting), as well as improving decision making through timely feedback on health system performance (such as through summary data dashboards or routine data review meetings). The most striking differences between partnership approaches can be found in the level of emphasis of data collection (patient versus health facility), and consequently the level of decision making enhancement (community, facility, district, or provincial leadership).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDISCUSSION: Design differences across PHIT Partnerships reflect differing theories of change, particularly regarding what information is needed, who will use the information to affect change, and how this change is expected to manifest. The iterative process of data use to monitor and assess the health system has been heavily communication dependent, with challenges due to poor feedback loops. Implementation to date has highlighted the importance of engaging frontline staff and managers in improving data collection and its use for informing system improvement. Through rigorous process and impact evaluation, the experience of the PHIT teams hope to contribute to the evidence base in the areas of HIS strengthening, linking HIS with decision making, and its impact on measures of health system outputs and impact.},

	abstract = {At the onset of health system decentralization as a primary health care strategy, which constituted a key feature of health sector reforms across the developing world, efficient and effective health management information systems (HMIS) were widely acknowledged and adopted as a critical element of district health management strengthening programmes. The focal concern was about the performance and long-term sustainability of decentralized district health systems. The underlying logic was that effective and efficient HMIS would provide district health managers with the information required to make effective strategic decisions that are the vehicle for district performance and sustainability in these decentralized health systems. However, this argument is rooted in normative management and decision theory without significant unequivocal empirical corroboration. Indeed, extensive empirical evidence continues to indicate that managers' decision-making behaviour and the existence of other forms of information outside the HMIS, within the organizational environment, suggest a far more tenuous relationship between the presence of organizational management information systems (such as HMIS) and effective strategic decision-making. This qualitative comparative case-study conducted in two districts of Zambia focused on investigating the presence and behaviour of five formally identified, different information forms, including that from HMIS, in the strategic decision-making process. The aim was to determine the validity of current arguments for HMIS, and establish implications for current HMIS policies. Evidence from the eight strategic decision-making processes traced in the study confirmed the existence of different forms of information in the organizational environment, including that provided by the conventional HMIS. These information forms attach themselves to various organizational management processes and key aspects of organizational routine. The study results point to the need for a radical re-think of district health management information solutions in ways that account for the existence of other information forms outside the formal HMIS in the district health system.},

	doi = {10.1186/1478-7954-11-12},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selection bias is common in clinic-based HIV surveillance. Clinics located in HIV hotspots are often the first to be chosen and monitored, while clinics in less prevalent areas are added to the surveillance system later on. Consequently, the estimated HIV prevalence based on clinic data is substantially distorted, with markedly higher HIV prevalence in the earlier periods and trends that reveal much more dramatic declines than actually occur. METHODS: Using simulations, we compare and contrast the performance of the various approaches and models for handling selection bias in clinic-based HIV surveillance. In particular, we compare the application of complete-case analysis and multiple imputation (MI). Several models are considered for each of the approaches. We demonstrate the application of the methods through sentinel surveillance data collected between 2002 and 2008 from India. RESULTS: Simulations suggested that selection bias, if not handled properly, can lead to biased estimates of HIV prevalence trends and inaccurate evaluation of program impact. Complete-case analysis and MI differed considerably in their ability to handle selection bias. In scenarios where HIV prevalence remained constant over time (i.e. β = 0), the estimated β{\textasciicircum}1 derived from MI tended to be biased downward. Depending on the imputation model used, the estimated bias ranged from -1.883 to -0.048 in logit prevalence. Furthermore, as the level of selection bias intensified, the extent of bias also increased. In contrast, the estimates yielded by complete-case analysis were relatively unbiased and stable across the various scenarios. The estimated bias ranged from -0.002 to 0.002 in logit prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Given that selection bias is common in clinic-based HIV surveillance, when analyzing data from such sources appropriate adjustment methods need to be applied. The results in this paper suggest that indiscriminant application of imputation models can lead to biased results.},

Consistency was measured as the absence of extreme outliers, internal consistency between related indicators, and consistency of indicators over time. These assessments were done at the district and national level.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Nationally, the average monthly district reporting completeness rate was 98\% across 10 key indicators from 2008 to 2012. Completeness of indicator data increased over time: 2008, 88\%; 2009, 91\%; 2010, 89\%; 2011, 90\%; and 2012, 95\% (p{\textless}0.0001). Comparing 2011 and 2012 health events to the mean of the three preceding years, service output increased from 3\% (2011) to 9\% (2012). Eighty-three percent of districts reported ratios between related indicators (ANC/DTP1, DTP1/DTP3) consistent with HMIS national ratios. Conclusion and policy implications: Our findings suggest that HMIS data quality in Rwanda has been improving over time. We recommend maintaining these assessments to identify remaining gaps in data quality and that results are shared publicly to support increased use of HMIS data.},

	doi = {10.1186/1476-072X-8-13},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Efforts to tackle the enormous burden of ill-health in low-income countries are hampered by weak health information infrastructures that do not support appropriate planning and resource allocation. For health information systems to function well, a reliable inventory of health service providers is critical. The spatial referencing of service providers to allow their representation in a geographic information system is vital if the full planning potential of such data is to be realized. METHODS: A disparate series of contemporary lists of health service providers were used to update a public health facility database of Kenya last compiled in 2003. These new lists were derived primarily through the national distribution of antimalarial and antiretroviral commodities since 2006. A combination of methods, including global positioning systems, was used to map service providers. These spatially-referenced data were combined with high-resolution population maps to analyze disparity in geographic access to public health care. FINDINGS: The updated 2008 database contained 5,334 public health facilities (67\% ministry of health; 28\% mission and nongovernmental organizations; 2\% local authorities; and 3\% employers and other ministries). This represented an overall increase of 1,862 facilities compared to 2003. Most of the additional facilities belonged to the ministry of health (79\%) and the majority were dispensaries (91\%). 93\% of the health facilities were spatially referenced, 38\% using global positioning systems compared to 21\% in 2003. 89\% of the population was within 5 km Euclidean distance to a public health facility in 2008 compared to 71\% in 2003. Over 80\% of the population outside 5 km of public health service providers was in the sparsely settled pastoralist areas of the country. CONCLUSION: We have shown that, with concerted effort, a relatively complete inventory of mapped health services is possible with enormous potential for improving planning. Expansion in public health care in Kenya has resulted in significant increases in geographic access although several areas of the country need further improvements. This information is key to future planning and with this paper we have released the digital spatial database in the public domain to assist the Kenyan Government and its partners in the health sector.},

	abstract = {Equity is an important criterion in evaluating health system performance. Developing a framework for equitable and effective resource allocation for health depends upon knowledge of service providers and their location in relation to the population they should serve. The last available map of health service providers in Kenya was developed in 1959. We have built a health service provider database from a variety of traditional government and opportunistic non-government sources and positioned spatially these facilities using global positioning systems, hand-drawn maps, topographical maps and other sources. Of 6674 identified service providers, 3355 (50\%) were private sector, employer-provided or specialist facilities and only 39\% were registered in the Kenyan Ministry of Health database during 2001. Of 3319 public service facilities supported by the Ministry of Health, missions, not-for-profit organizations and local authorities, 84\% were registered on a Ministry of Health database and we were able to acquire co-ordinates for 92\% of these. The ratio of public health services to population changed from 1:26,000 in 1959 to 1:9300 in 1999-2002. There were 82\% of the population within 5 km of a public health facility and resident in 20\% of the country. Our efforts to recreate a comprehensive, spatially defined list of health service providers has identified a number of weaknesses in existing national health management information systems, which with an increased commitment and minimal costs can be redressed. This will enable geographic information systems to exploit more fully facility-based morbidity data, population distribution and health access models to target resources and monitor the ability of health sector reforms to achieve equity in service provision.},

	abstract = {Background: Good quality and timely data from health information systems are the foundation of all health systems. However, too often data sit in reports, on shelves or in databases and are not sufficiently utilised in policy and program development, improvement, strategic planning and advocacy. Without specific interventions aimed at improving the use of data produced by information systems, health systems will never fully be able to meet the needs of the populations they serve. Objective: To employ a logic model to describe a pathway of how specific activities and interventions can strengthen the use of health data in decision making to ultimately strengthen the health system. Design: A logic model was developed to provide a practical strategy for developing, monitoring and evaluating interventions to strengthen the use of data in decision making. The model draws on the collective strengths and similarities of previous work and adds to those previous works by making specific recommendations about interventions and activities that are most proximate to affect the use of data in decision making. The model provides an organizing framework for how interventions and activities work to strengthen the systematic demand, synthesis, review, and use of data. Results: The logic model and guidance are presented to facilitate its widespread use and to enable improved data-informed decision making in program review and planning, advocacy, policy development. Real world examples from the literature support the feasible application of the activities outlined in the model. Conclusions: The logic model provides specific and comprehensive guidance to improve data demand and use. It can be used to design, monitor and evaluate interventions, and to improve demand for, and use of, data in decision making. As more interventions are implemented to improve use of health data, those efforts need to be evaluated. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

This study explored the gaps and factors influencing HMIS in the context of a changing health sector in Tanzania. METHODS: A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted in 11 heath facilities in Kilombero district between January and February 2008. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview 43 health workers on their knowledge, attitude, practice and factors for change on HMIS and HMIS booklets from these facilities were reviewed for completeness. RESULTS: Of all respondents, 81\% had never been trained on HMIS, 65\% did not properly define this system, 54\% didn't know who is supposed to use the information collected and 42\% did not use the collected data for planning, budgeting and evaluation of services provision. Although the attitude towards the system was positive among 91\%, the reviewed HMIS booklets were never completed in 25\% - 55\% of the facilities. There were no significant differences in knowledge, attitude and practice on HMIS between clinicians and nurses. The most common type of HMIS booklets which were never filled were those for deliveries (55\%). The gaps in the current HMIS were linked to lack of training, inactive supervision, staff workload pressure and the lengthy and laborious nature of the system. CONCLUSIONS: This research has revealed a state of poor health data collection, lack of informed decision-making at the facility level and the factors for change in the country's HMIS. It suggests need for new innovations including incorporation of HMIS in the ongoing reviews of the curricula for all cadres of health care providers, development of more user-friendly system and use of evidence-based John Kotter's eight-step process for implementing successful changes in this system.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2012.07.010},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is estimated that one million people infected with HIV initiate anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in resource-constrained countries annually. This occurs against a background of overburdened health workers with limited skills to handle rapidly changing treatment standards and guidelines hence compromising quality of care. Electronic medical record (EMR)-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are considered a solution to improve quality of care. Little evidence, however, exists on the effectiveness of EMR-based CDSS on quality of HIV care and treatment in resource-constrained settings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to identify original studies on EMR-based CDSS describing process and outcome measures as well as reported barriers to their implementation in resource-constrained settings. We characterized the studies by guideline adherence, data and process, and barriers to CDSS implementation. METHODS: Two reviewers independently assessed original articles from a search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Global Health Library databases until January 2012. The included articles were those that evaluated or described the implementation of EMR-based CDSS that were used in HIV care in low-income countries. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria, 10 of which were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and 2 in the Caribbean. None of the papers described a strong (randomized controlled) evaluation design. Guideline adherence: One study showed that ordering rates for CD4 tests were significantly higher when reminders were used. Data and process: Studies reported reduction in data errors, reduction in missed appointments, reduction in missed CD4 results and reduction in patient waiting time. Two studies showed a significant increase in time spent by clinicians on direct patient care. Barriers to CDSS implementation: Technical infrastructure problems such as unreliable electric power and erratic Internet connectivity, clinicians' limited computer skills and failure by providers to comply with the reminders are key impediments to the implementation and effective use of CDSS. CONCLUSION: The limited number of evaluation studies, the basic and heterogeneous study designs, and varied outcome measures make it difficult to meaningfully conclude on the effectiveness of CDSS on quality of HIV care and treatment in resource-limited settings. High quality evaluation studies are needed. Factors specific to implementation of EMR-based CDSS in resource-limited setting should be addressed before such countries can demonstrate its full benefits. More work needs to be done to overcome the barriers to EMR and CDSS implementation in developing countries such as technical infrastructure and care providers' computer illiteracy. However, simultaneously evaluating and describing CDSS implementation strategies that work can further guide wise investments in their wider rollout.},

We present a conceptual model connecting CRVS to wellbeing, and describe an ecological association between CRVS and health outcomes. The conceptual model posits that the legal identity that civil registration provides to individuals is key to access entitlements and services. Vital statistics produced by CRVS systems provide essential information for public health policy and prevention. These outcomes benefit individuals and societies, including improved health. We use marginal linear models and lag-lead analysis to measure ecological associations between a composite metric of CRVS performance and three health outcomes. Results are consistent with the conceptual model: improved CRVS performance coincides with improved health outcomes worldwide in a temporally consistent manner. Investment to strengthen CRVS systems is not only an important goal for individuals and societies, but also a development imperative that is good for health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare hospital discharge data (PMSI) with data in the reference databases: vital statistics and National Perinatal Surveys (NPS) for the principal perinatal indicators. METHODS: Data concerning hospitalizations for delivery and childbirth were extracted from the PMSI 2010 database. The exhaustiveness was assessed by comparing discharge data with data from birth certificates. Indicators were compared with those in the 2010 NPS, which was based on a representative sample of births (n=15,000), using 95\% confidence intervals. RESULTS: About 823,360 hospital abstracts with delivery and 829,351 hospital abstracts with live births were considered. The exhaustiveness of the PMSI was 99.6\% for live births in Metropolitan France. The distribution of maternal age, mode of delivery, birth weight and gestational age in the PMSI and NPS were very similar. In Metropolitan France, the prematurity rate was 6.9\% (PMSI) vs. 6.6\% [6.2-7.0] (NPS) and the rate of caesarean was 20.6\% vs. 20.4\% [19.8-21.1]. There were marked differences for the percentage of birth weights{\textless}2500g and for maternal diseases. CONCLUSION: The routine use of the PMSI for some indicators for follow-up purposes is foreseeable. Validation studies are still necessary for maternal diseases, for which recording is less standardized.},

In the wake of globalisation, developing countries have no choice but to take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges. The last decades saw developing countries taking action to strengthen and modernise their HMIS using the existing ICT. Due to poor economic and communication infrastructure, the process has been limited to national and provincial/region levels leaving behind majority of health workers living in remote/rural areas. Even those with access do not get maximum benefit from ICT advancements due to inadequacies in data quality and lack of data utilisation. Therefore, developing countries need to make deliberate efforts to address constraints threatening to increase technology gap between urban minority and rural majority by setting up favourable policies and appropriate strategies. Concurrently, strategies to improve data quality and utilisation should be instituted to ensure that HMIS has positive impact on people's health. Potential strength from private sector and opportunities for sharing experiences among developing countries should be utilised. Short of this, advancement in ICT will continue to marginalise health workers in developing countries especially those living in remote areas.},

	abstract = {In 2003, the Uganda Ministry of Health introduced the district league table for district health system performance assessment. The league table presents district performance against a number of input, process and output indicators and a composite index to rank districts. This study explores the use of hierarchical cluster analysis for analysing and presenting district health systems performance data and compares this approach with the use of the league table in Uganda. Ministry of Health and district plans and reports, and published documents were used to provide information on the development and utilization of the Uganda district league table. Quantitative data were accessed from the Ministry of Health databases. Statistical analysis using SPSS version 20 and hierarchical cluster analysis, utilizing Wards' method was used. The hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on the basis of seven clusters determined for each year from 2003 to 2010, ranging from a cluster of good through moderate-to-poor performers. The characteristics and membership of clusters varied from year to year and were determined by the identity and magnitude of performance of the individual variables. Criticisms of the league table include: perceived unfairness, as it did not take into consideration district peculiarities; and being oversummarized and not adequately informative. Clustering organizes the many data points into clusters of similar entities according to an agreed set of indicators and can provide the beginning point for identifying factors behind the observed performance of districts. Although league table ranking emphasize summation and external control, clustering has the potential to encourage a formative, learning approach. More research is required to shed more light on factors behind observed performance of the different clusters. Other countries especially low-income countries that share many similarities with Uganda can learn from these experiences.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Routine monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for measuring program success and accurate drug forecasting. However, compiling data from patient registers to measure retention in ART is labour-intensive. To address this challenge, we conducted a pilot study in Malawi to assess whether patient ART retention could be determined using pharmacy records as compared to estimates of retention based on standardized paper- or electronic based cohort reports. .Methods: Twelve ART facilities were included in the study: six used paper-based registers and six used electronic data systems. One ART facility implemented an electronic data system in quarter three and was included as a paper-based system facility in quarter two only. Routine patient retention cohort reports, paper or electronic, were collected from facilities for both quarter two [April-June] and quarter three [July-September], 2010. Pharmacy stock data were also collected from the 12 ART facilities over the same period. Numbers of ART continuation bottles recorded on pharmacy stock cards at the beginning and end of each quarter were documented. These pharmacy data were used to calculate the total bottles dispensed to patients in each quarter with intent to estimate the number of patients retained on ART. Information for time required to determine ART retention was gathered through interviews with clinicians tasked with compiling the data. RESULTS: Among ART clinics with paper-based systems, three of six facilities in quarter two and four of five facilities in quarter three had similar patient numbers of patients retained on ART comparing cohort reports to pharmacy stock records. In ART clinics with electronic systems, five of six facilities in quarter two and five of seven facilities in quarter three had similar numbers of ART patients when comparing retention numbers from electronically generated cohort reports to pharmacy stock records. Among paper-based facilities, an average of 13 hours was needed to calculate patient retention for cohort report using patient registers as compared to 2.25 hours using pharmacy stock cards. CONCLUSION: The numbers of patients retained on ART as estimated using pharmacy stock records were largely similar to estimates based on either paper registers or an electronic data system. Furthermore, less time and staff effort was needed to estimate ART patient retention using pharmacy stock records versus paper-based registers. Reinforcing ARV stock management may improve the precision of estimates.},

	abstract = {The regions, nations, and communities that comprise the developing world face a wide variety of health-related challenges, and the health systems that adress those challenges are struggling with limited resources and capability. Health leaders must therefore focus on maximizing the value of scarce resources and finding ways to make health system operate as efficiently as possible. Having reliable data on the performance of different parts of the health system is the only way to devise, execute, and measure health interventions. Successful strengthening of health systems wull require relevant, timely, and accurate information on the performance of the health system itself. The goal of a health information system (HIS) is to provide that information. This document considers several aspects of health information systems for developing countries. First, it looks at the threats to health and the challenges facing health care systems in the developiing world. Next, it surveys the landscape of efforts to specify and create successful HIS at the national level. Then it examines three case studies in depth and finally reviews the important challenges and oportunities associated with creating an efective HIS.},

	abstract = {Routine health information systems (RHISs) are in place in nearly every country and provide routinely collected full-coverage records on all levels of health system service delivery. However, these rich sources of data are regularly overlooked for evaluating causal effects of health programmes due to concerns regarding completeness, timeliness, representativeness and accuracy. Using Mozambique's national RHIS (Módulo Básico) as an illustrative example, we urge renewed attention to the use of RHIS data for health evaluations. Interventions to improve data quality exist and have been tested in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Intrinsic features of RHIS data (numerous repeated observations over extended periods of time, full coverage of health facilities, and numerous real-time indicators of service coverage and utilization) provide for very robust quasi-experimental designs, such as controlled interrupted time-series (cITS), which are not possible with intermittent community sample surveys. In addition, cITS analyses are well suited for continuously evolving development contexts in LMICs by: (1) allowing for measurement and controlling for trends and other patterns before, during and after intervention implementation; (2) facilitating the use of numerous simultaneous control groups and non-equivalent dependent variables at multiple nested levels to increase validity and strength of causal inference; and (3) allowing the integration of continuous 'effective dose received' implementation measures. With expanded use of RHIS data for the evaluation of health programmes, investments in data systems, health worker interest in and utilization of RHIS data, as well as data quality will further increase over time. Because RHIS data are ministry-owned and operated, relying upon these data will contribute to sustainable national capacity over time.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2458-12-741},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the developed world, information on vital events is routinely collected nationally to inform population and health policies. However, in many low-and middle-income countries, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is a lack of effective and comprehensive national civil registration and vital statistics system. In the past decades, the number of Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSSs) has increased throughout SSA. An HDSS monitors births, deaths, causes of death, migration, and other health and socio-economic indicators within a defined population over time. Currently, the International Network for the Continuous Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health (INDEPTH) brings together 38 member research centers which run 44 HDSS sites from 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Oceana. Thirty two of these HDSS sites are in SSA.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nDISCUSSION: This paper argues that, in the absence of an adequate national CRVS, HDSSs should be more effectively utilised to generate relevant public health data, and also to create local capacity for longitudinal data collection and management systems in SSA. If HDSSs get strategically located to cover different geographical regions in a country, data from these sites could be used to provide a more complete national picture of the health of the population. They provide useful data that can be extrapolated for national estimates if their regional coverage is well planned. HDSSs are however resource-intensive. Efforts are being put towards getting them linked to local or national policy contexts and to reduce their dependence on external funding. Increasing their number in SSA to cover a critical proportion of the population, especially urban populations, must be carefully planned. Strategic planning is needed at national levels to geographically locate HDSS sites and to support these through national funding mechanisms.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nSUMMARY: The paper does not suggest that HDSSs should be seen as a replacement for civil registration systems. Rather, they should serve as a short- to medium-term measure to provide data for health and population planning at regional levels with possible extrapolation to national levels. HDSSs can also provide useful lessons for countries that intend to set up nationally representative sample vital registration systems in the long term.},

	abstract = {In low-income settings, vaccination campaigns supplement routine immunization but often fail to
achieve coverage goals due to uncertainty about target population size and distribution. Accurate,
updated estimates of target populations are rare but critical; short-term fluctuations can greatly impact
population size and susceptibility. We use satellite imagery to quantify population fluctuations and the
coverage achieved by a measles outbreak response vaccination campaign in urban Niger and compare
campaign estimates to measurements from a post-campaign survey. Vaccine coverage was overestimated
because the campaign underestimated resident numbers and seasonal migration further increased
the target population. We combine satellite-derived measurements of fluctuations in population
distribution with high-resolution measles case reports to develop a dynamic model that illustrates the
potential improvement in vaccination campaign coverage if planners account for predictable population
fluctuations. Satellite imagery can improve retrospective estimates of vaccination campaign impact and
future campaign planning by synchronizing interventions with predictable population fluxes.},
